# vat-calc-react

A very basic Vat Calculator. The top element will calulate the value of the given sum. The following section is for use when calculating values when submitting quaterly VAT returns. At this point the VAT is fixed at 20%. i would like to add functionality to be able to change that ammount depending on what is required. 

For the CSS i used botoxparty which can be found here: https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css/. i used the option for windows 98. 

The site is not fully responsive yet . I would like to encorperate the use of Sass as a further step.
