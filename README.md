# vat-calc-react
This was my first project buit with react. I learned a lot about props and state. It also uses botoxparty css to give it a retro look. I designed this for a specific use case and it works as required. I would like to have added functionality to switch the css between the windows 95 style and the 98 but I have realised that that is best left for later.
